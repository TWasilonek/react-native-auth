## Description

This project is a simple authentication React Native app.
My goal was to ctreate a template that I can reuse in my apps, that gives me the most needed frontend authentication pieces:
  * The auth flow logic,
  * Auth flow screen templates: Login, Sign Up and Forgot Password,
  * React Navigation for navigating,
  * State management template with Redux and Redux Saga,
  * Simple stubbed api that is a starting point to implement any authentication provider.
